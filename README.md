An e-commerce website with both customer-facing and admin sections.

## Description

The semester project January 22 we were to build a frontend for a e-commerce website with both customer-facing and admin sections.
We were free to choose the theme and tool to create this website, my choice was using Bootstrap and SASS which was something I wasn't familier with.
We also had to follow these bulletpoints for the assignment:

- Build a frontend with home, product list, product detail and cart pages.
- Build admin pages to create, update and delete products.
- The website must be responsive on all devices.
- Building a checkout and payment system is not a part of the project.

## Built With

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Pre-requirements

This assignment requires you to run a service that provides an API for the products.
